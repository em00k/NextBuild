# NextBuild v7 Full Release 

## NextBuild : A suite of tools based on Boriel's ZX Basic Compiler targetting the ZX Spectrum Next.

This is a collection of tools, plugins, scripts and launchers for Visual Studio Code to allow you to write software for the
ZX Spectrum Next and the normal Spectrum, if you use Fuse. It aims to simplify the process by having a one-click launcher
into an editor where you can simply press F5 to build a Boriel BASIC .bas file and run your project, if it builds OK, with CSpect.

## What does it contain?

**Boriel's ZX Basic (ZXB)** - A PC based language which resembles ZX Basic but allows
SUBs/FUNcs inline ASM and a bunch of other features and is SUPER fast. By Jose Rodriguez (https://github.com/boriel/zxbasic)

Please note that the version of ZX Basic Compiler has been modified to specially work with the Next - dropping the latest 
versions of the compiler is not supported - and will probably lead to random crashing on real HW. You have been warned!

**CSpect** - One of the premiere ZX Spectrun Next emulators By Mike Dailly full download is https://mdf200.itch.io/cspect
located in \Emu\cspect\

Scripts, NextLib and launchers by em00k.

## Installing Mono

NextBuild is known to work with at least the Windows and Linux versions of VSCode. However, CSpect requires the mono libraries
to run and mono is often not installed by default by most Linux distributions or MacOS.

To use NextBuild and run CSpect under Linux you must install the mono runtime and libraries using the recommened package manager
for your distribution.

Users of Debian and Ubuntu based Linux distros can install mono by running:

`sudo apt install mono-complete`

## Thanks

Thanks to the many wonderful people that have helped, such Michael Flash Ware for the Tile print code,
Jose for his support, Mike Dailly for code examples, Gary Lancaster for his inpsiration in NextZXOS, 

As mentioned ZXB lets you use inline ASM so creating macros and includes to control the Next 
hardware is easily done as well as being very much like ZX Basic but much much faster! 
There is a whole wiki dedicated to ZXBasic here https://zxbasic.readthedocs.io/en/docs

Please report any bugs and I will try to fix them.

## News

- 11/12/23  -   updated Boriel to 1.17.1 and CSpect to 2.19.5 

http://zxnext.uk/nextbuild/

- Latest ZXBasic Compiler included v1.6.4
- Now generates NEX & bin files 
- Scripts rewritten in python so will work on Win, Mac & Linux

**VSCode will install the NextBuild VSCode extension**

****When you start Vscode, choose "Open Folder" and point to "Sources" in the Nextbuild folder.****

Download the archive and extract to a folder, launch VScode
and choose "Open Folder", select the "Sources" folder inside
of \NextBuildv7 

Load a source .bas file (try examples) and then compile by
using the terminal menu and Run Build Task - you can configure
a keyboard shortcut in your prefs. 

This should compile and launch in CSpect if there is an error 
the Compile.txt is opened in the default text editor. 

See the video below on how to setup for Windows & VSCode
