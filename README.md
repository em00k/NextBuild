# NextBuild v6
NextBuild : A suite of tools based on Boriel's ZX Basic Compiler targetting the ZX Spectrum Next

This is the latest version I have been trying to get out, a few suggested hosting on git so it can be a WIP.

Please report any bugs and I will try to fix them.

You will need this for VSC if not using BorIDE or something similar:

NOTE : the demo .bas file have an associated .cfg file that stores the ORG address from BorIDE, so if demos fail to work, check the .cfg in a text editor as some depend on a starting address being set.
